SoursoupLeafDryer using Control Fuzzy
=======================



The purpose of this research is to find out how to make a soursop leaf dryer with fuzzy
logic method. With a drying method at 50Â°C for 2 hours so that the properties of
soursop leaves are not affected by temperatures that are too high for a long period
of time.


Requirements
============

| Library   | Function                                                                                  |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fuzzy.h   | Implements fuzzy logic control for decision-making.                                       |
| MAX6675.h | Reads temperature data from the MAX6675 thermocouple sensor.                              |
| SPI.h     | Manages Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication with external devices.            |
| Wire.h    | Manages I2C communication, typically used for devices like OLED displays. (Not explicitly used in this program) |
